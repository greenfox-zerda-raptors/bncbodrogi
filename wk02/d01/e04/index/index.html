      Pulling your strings. Shit outta luck. Ever was. Nothing can save you. Turning. This world coming to?. Money talking. On the crooked borderline. Ending is near. So real. And she keeps me satisfied, gives me all I need. And the earth becomes my throne. So unfeeling. In the name of desperation

    <p>What is this hell you have put me through. Twisting. On our way, hiding. Hidden from this thing that they call life. Don't cry to me oh baby. Seek and Destroy. But it's nothing new. Disturbing thoughts, questions pending.
